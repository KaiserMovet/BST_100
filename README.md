# BST_100

## Implementation of BST in various programming languages

This project consists of implementations of BST (Binary Search Tree) in various programming languages. A BST is a data structure that allows for fast searching, adding, and removing of elements in logarithmic time. Each of the implementations has been performance-tested by performing 5,000,000 additions of numbers to the tree, followed by 10,000,000 checks to see if the tree contains elements.

## Implementations

The project currently includes implementations of BST in the following languages:

- Python3
- C++
- C
- Lua

Each implementation is located in a separate directory in the repository.
All implementations are based on two classes, Node and Tree.
The Node class represents a single node in the BST. It contains an integer value and references to its left and right child nodes. The class provides methods to add a value, check if a value is present, calculate the length (number of nodes) in the subtree, and calculate the height (maximum depth) of the subtree.

The Tree class serves as the entry point for interacting with the BST. It maintains a reference to the root node of the tree and provides methods to add a value, check if a value is present, calculate the length of the tree, and calculate the height of the tree.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class Node {
    - int value
    - Node left
    - Node right

    + add(int value) bool
    + contain(int value) bool
    + length() bool
    + height() bool
}

class Tree {
    - Node root

    + add(int value) bool
    + contain(int value) bool
    + length() bool
    + height() bool
}
```

In some cases, the implementation may differ depending on the language.

## Performance tests

The following tests were conducted:

- 5 million elements were added to the tree.
- 10 million checks were performed to see if an element exists.
- The time to count the elements in the tree was measured.
- The height of the tree was calculated.

  Each test was repeated 3 times and then the average was calculated.
  Final BST has 5.000.000 elements and 57 levels

Here are the performance test results for each implementation:

| Language | Version | Add Time (s) | Contains Time (s) | Count Elements Time (s) | Height Time (s) |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Python   | 3.11.0  | 45.12        | 54.78             | 2.26                    | 2.69            |
| C++      | gcc 12  | 8.01         | 9.55              | 0.38                    | 0.51            |
| C        | c99     | 7.33         | 9.00              | 0.00                    | 0.00            |
| Lua      | 5.4.3   | 41.89        | 48.37             | 2.95                    | 3.36            |
| Rust     | 1.67    | 11.24        | 13.04             | 0.59                    | 0.59            |

## Requirements

To run the code in each language, you will need to have Docker installed.

## Running the code

To run the code in each language, navigate to the appropriate directory in the repository and run `./run.sh`.
